# Implementing-RecM--Regular-Expression-Combo-Machine

RecM will be used for many tasks related to REs, most important of which is searching acceptable strings in a given text file. 

This program takes two inputs: a regular expression and a text file. 

As output, this program will print following files:  

NFA.txt This file will have the complete NFA for RE, i.e. Alphabet, Start states, Final states and transition table. 

DFA.txt  This file will have the complete DFA specification of the RE. 

MinDFA.txt This file will have the transition table of minimum DFA of the RE. 

CFG.txt Contains context free grammar for the given RE. 

Output.txt Contains those lines of the input text file, which contain strings that match the given RE.
